## Project Title
>Project `Messiah`

## Project Description
It is a mobile application that can be downloaded from Google Playstore once it is available. `For the current release we have targetted the Android devices`.

## Current Problem

## Solution Description

Project Messiah is an android application that provides many computational models and predictive models, which can work with the forecasting of the disasters. It also automates the disaster management, by efficiently deploying proper disaster teams based on the disaster incident language intent analysis. It also provides the user with an in-hand application to trigger the disaster SOS. 

## Included Components
Below is the list of IBM Cloud Resources we have used in `Project Messiah`
  - IBM Machine learning
  - IBM Weather API
  - IBM Image Visualizer Service
  - IBM chat assistant
  - IBM Tone Analyzer
  - IBM NLP analysis
  - IBM DB2 database
  - TWILIO messaging API
  - .NET SDK for middleware
  - IOT Service

## Featured Technologies
  - Ionic framework
  - Android Platform Studio
  - HTML/SCSS/typeScript

## Results and improvements
  - Improvement in the smart navigation algorithm to navigate the user out of the disaster affected zone considering the parameters like - road traffic, image analysis of the disaster affected roadways.
  - Implementation of the mobile wi-bots that can carry messiah IOT devices in the disaster affected areas.
  - Implementation of the satellite image analysis based on the RGB differential correction of the disaster affected area - taking the color difference of the images to calculate the area of the disaster affected zone and show it to user on the map.
  - Implementation of modelling of the safe houses and the realtime capacity of the safe house with the help of the clustered phone data.
  - Improvement of fully automated AI bot to deploy the disaster teams based on the user's input and validation of the score on the truthfulness of the news - a set intersection score between the area news headlines, satellite image and the disaster prediction score model. We can also ask for user's true situation validation.
  - Improvement in the NLP analysis to auto-classify the incident with `minimum` inputs from the user.
